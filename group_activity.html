<!-- :movie_camera: Exercise 1: Pet Adoption Form
Objective: The objective of this exercise is to reinforce understanding of HTML forms, events, and document manipulation in JavaScript by creating a pet adoption form for a virtual pet adoption agency.
Problem Statement: You are tasked with developing a pet adoption form that allows users to input information about pets available for adoption. The form should capture details such as pet name, age, breed, and adoption status. Users can submit the form to add a new pet.
Instructions:
Create an HTML form with input fields for pet name, age, breed, and adoption status.
Implement JavaScript event handlers to capture form submissions and retrieve input values.
Use DOM manipulation techniques to dynamically update the webpage with information about the newly added pet.
Validate user input to ensure required fields are filled and age is a numeric value.
Style the form and pet information display for an appealing user interface.
Hints:
Utilize the submit event of the form element to capture form submissions.
Use document.createElement() and appendChild() methods to dynamically create and add elements to the DOM.
Implement form validation using conditional statements and regular expressions.
Apply CSS styles to enhance the visual appearance of the form and pet information display. -->
